# Welcome
Hello, my name is S0m3_random_guy! (You probably never heard of me) I am a beginner and I just started to code. Maybe you're like me, and just starting or maybe you're a pro. But enough of this nonsense, let's see what is this project about.

## About this project
I bet you heard of Xbox. If not, Xbox is a gaming console first presented on the 15th of November, 2001, created by Microsoft corporation, in order to compete with the dominating Playstation 2. Xbox sold 24 million units total, but that was nowhere near Playstation 2, with 155 million sales and rising. Xbox 360 hit the market on the 22nd of November, 2005, and the sales went up as the console was recived way better than the 1st generation, selling around 84 million of them. At the time this project began in the January of 2020, Xbox One was the latest console released by Microsoft, and as for that, Mbox is made to reference Xbox One, and not Xbox Series X. The idea of this project was to create a console integrated into Makecode arcade, and then, let the community create and submit games to be built into Mbox.

-- This project is still in early access, currently in version [Alpha 0.01]. Name 'Mbox' is only a placeholder and might be changed in the future. --
